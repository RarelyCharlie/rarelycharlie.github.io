7 Cups cannot support people who are actively suicidal, where actively means they are right now taking action to end their life. This is 7 Cups' policy and you have no choice about it.

You can set a personal boundary regarding suicide if you wish. For example, you might decide that you will not listen to any talk of suicide at all. It's also OK to allow members to talk about their thoughts of suicide if you feel you can support members in that way. Thoughts of suicide are not dangerous in themselves, and many people have them.

Members sometimes threaten suicide as a way of controlling the chat. It can be difficult to think straight when a member is controlling. A good response is to reflect the member's feeling in the usual way, without trying to solve the member's problem:

Member: *“You're my last chance. If you refuse to help me I'm going to end it all. And I don't want any helplines to call or bs like that.”*
{: .conv}

Listener: *“You feel that threatening suicide is a good way to get me to help you.”*
{: .conv}

When you have to end a chat because the member is actively suicidal, you should normally give the member information about specialist suicide services local to them. The easiest way to do this is to refer them to suicide.org where they can find relevant information depending on where they are in the world. Do not assume that the member is in the same country as you.

Be careful not to give the impression that 7 Cups is giving up on the member. Withdrawing emotional support in time of crisis might make the crisis much worse. It may be appropriate to refer the member to another listener who is more comfortable with talk of suicide. You can ask for help in the Listeners Support Room to discuss this.

If a member is actively suicidal and you get the impression that there is a medical emergency or an imminent risk of actual harm, then you should normally recommend that the member contact their local emergency services. Do not assume that their local emergency number is the same as yours, and do not assume that their emergency services work the same way yours do.

Never contact emergency services yourself on behalf of a member.

After the quiz, we'll look at time limits.

A member says:
{: data-n="6" data-opt="Yes,No"}

*“Sometimes I think of ways to kill myself.”*
{: .conv}

*“I imagine what it would be like to die and how people would react.”*
{: .conv}

*“I think they'd just forget about me the next day LOL”*
{: .conv}

Which of the following could be appropriate replies?
