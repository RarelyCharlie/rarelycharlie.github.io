Listeners can provide emotional support to members in chatrooms and forums. The principles of active listening are exactly the same as in 1-to-1 chats, but there are some minor differences.

In a chatroom the conversation can move very fast if many people are engaged, so this can make long, thoughtful replies to members impossible. However, if you make all your responses very short and snappy then you might not be able to provide effective emotional support. You have to find a balance that suits you and the chatroom, or use the chatroom to initiate 1-to-1 chats where you can provide better support.

In a forum you have plenty of time for a long, thoughtful reply if that seems appropriate. This can mean you include more information than you would in a chat. However, it is not good to ramble on at great length in someone else's thread. If you have a lot to say about something, you can start your own thread and link to it from your messages to members in chats.

The essentials of active listening apply in forums just like they do in 1-to-1 chats:
{: .showul}

- Demonstrate that you understand what the member is saying by reflecting the emotion and summarizing the other content. Use the member's exact words.

- Demonstrate that you are genuinely present in the discussion by reacting authentically and sharing your point of view.

- Demonstrate your support by seeing the big picture, drawing out emotional detail, or self-disclosure.

- Avoid the common mistakes of self-centered thinking, sympathy, problem-solving and advice.

- Optionally offer a 1-to-1 chat if the original poster wants to follow up in private.

In some chatrooms and forums you can use your member account to participate as a member. Then you can give advice, make suggestions and talk about yourself (things that you should not do from your listener account).

In chatrooms and forums it's OK to invite members to send you messages if they would like to chat with you 1-to-1, or you can send messages to them. You should only issue invitations like this if you are genuinely prepared to have those 1-to-1 chats.

After the quiz, we'll look at the support available to you as a listener.

A member says:
{: data-n="6" data-opt="Yes,No"}

*“In the hospital I had nothing at all to do. That was the worst part, feeling I was a useless waste of space and always would be.”*
{: .conv}

Which of the following could be appropriate replies?
