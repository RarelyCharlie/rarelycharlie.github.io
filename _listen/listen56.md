This course was not the official listener training. As soon as you complete the official listener training you become a listener and the system will offer you general requests from members. It's up to you whether you take a request immediately or give yourself a little time to think about it first.

When you become a listener, immediately check your status. It should be set to offline (red) unless you are going to take a request.

If you set your status to online (green) then you might get a personal request at any timeâ€”this is OK just as long as it doesn't take you by surprise.

Before you take a request, set your status to busy (orange) and open your Notes. Remind yourself that you're here just to provide emotional support, and remind yourself of the decisions you made while you were taking this course about your personal boundaries.

Don't take it personally if your first chats are with ghosts (people who don't respond) or if they are sexual. New listeners are often targeted for sexual chats. Stick to plan and maintain the personal boundaries that you decided on.

If you're not confident about taking a 1-to-1 chat, go to the Listener Support Room or chat with any mentor first.

Consider making contact with a mentor anyway, just so you will have someone familiar to talk to about any problems that might come up later.

In the next section, the last in this course, we'll look at your listening journey in the future.
