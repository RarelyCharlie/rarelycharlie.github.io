Professionalism is an unusual aspect of listening because as a listener you are a volunteer. There are professional therapists on 7 Cups, but you are not a therapist. Professionalism for listeners means behaving in the kind of responsible ways that members would be entitled to expect of a professional.

### Language

The language you use in chats should be correct but conversational, not formal. For example, use full stops and capital letters correctly. Use conventional spelling.

You do not have to chat in English. You can use any language that both you and the member are fluent in.

It's OK to use conventional abbreviations and contractions.

Member: *“I'm sorry I didn't reply immediately. I had to take a call.”*
{: .conv}

Listener: *“It's OK!”*
{: .conv}

Avoid using very recent abbreviations and slang that would not be in a conventional dictionary. You'll often chat with members who are not using their first language and who may not be familiar with your local culture or with Internet culture.

Members sometimes use words or phrases that you might have to look up at urbandictionary.com but you should always write plainly in a way that anyone can understand..

### Shouting and cussing

Typing words in capital letters is considered to be shouting on the Internet, and you should never shout, not even if a member shouts at you.

All kinds of swearing are unprofessional, even if a member swears at you.

A member says:
{: data-n="6" data-opt="Yes,No"}

*“After that things just seemed like nothing mattered, like there was no point in anything much, no point in making everyday decisions.”*
{: .conv}
