Some listeners have personal boundaries that mean they will not talk about sexual matters, or certain sexual matters. Others consider sexuality to be just a normal part of life that it's natural to want to talk about. It is up to you whether you set boundaries and where you set them.

Think about it right now and decide where your boundaries are. You can change your mind later, but don't end up in the middle of a sexual chat without having thought about it.

You will encounter members who try to have explicitly sexual conversations with you. It's OK to think of these members as people who suffer severe social and communication difficulties, and to listen to them just as you would listen to any other members.

It's also OK to think of these chats as going beyond what's acceptable to you personally, and to end the chat. The decision is yours.

Often, sexual matters are mentioned in a chat that's really about something else, and if you focus on reflecting the member's feelings there will be no need to talk explicitly about sex:

Member: *“On the phone she always talks about doing unusual stuff. You know, kinky. I don't want to say what. But when I meet her she's like all shy. I don't understand what's going on. Do you think she's just messing with me? Do you want me to tell you the kind of things she talks about?”*

Listener: *“She's not consistent, and you don't understand her.”*

The 7 Cups system may interfere with some conversations about sexual matters by blocking messages. You might have to reassure members that it's OK to continue chatting. You can use deliberate misspellings to get around the system's sexual hangups.

After the quiz, we'll look at fantasy chats.

A member says:
{: data-n="6" data-opt="Yes,No"}

*“This all started seven years ago when our son was born. It was a terrible time for us. She was depressed after the birth for about two years, and my mother was dying. We got through all that though and for a time things were OK. We even got back to having sex. But now I've lost my job her depression seems to have returned. I don't know what to do.”*
