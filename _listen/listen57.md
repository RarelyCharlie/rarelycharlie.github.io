This is the final section of the course. Remember that you can return to the course at any time to refresh your memory about anything (and you won't have to do the quizzes).

After the initial training, listeners' journeys at 7 Cups take them in many different directions, and you will have choices to make about what's important to you and how you want to contribute.

Some listeners become very selective about the chats they take, perhaps developing longer-term relationships with a small number of members, or only chatting to members who have booked appointments.

Some listeners offer long-term support to some of the members they chat to. 7 Cups has a structured program that pairs listener sponsors with member sponsees. (The term sponsee comes from addiction programs, but at 7 Cups sponsees are not necessarily addicts.)

Some listeners drift away from 1-to-1 chats, spending most of their time in chatrooms or forums. Some drift away from supporting members altogether, spending most of their time supporting other listeners.

### Listening styles

Listeners who continue to take 1-to-1 chats mostly develop their own style of listening as they gain experience, using the style taught in their training only as a starting point. Developing your skills as a listener usually means becoming familiar with approaches used by therapists, even though it always remains important not to play at being a therapist yourself.

As a listener at 7 Cups you cannot enter into a real-life contract with a member in which you are professionally accountable. For this reason you can never responsibly try to give advice or provide therapy, no matter how skilled you feel you have become.

Listeners who want to continue to develop their skills in the style of this unofficial training can often learn from resources about *person centered*, *humanistic*, or *Rogerian* therapy, because it has a similar style.

Listeners who want to enter into longer-term relationships with members can often learn from resources about *transactional analysis*, which provides a framework for understanding how people interact.

Listeners who decide to ignore the warnings in this course about trying to find solutions to members' problems can often learn from resources about *solution-focused therapy*.

Listeners who decide to ignore the warnings in this course about giving advice and playing at being therapists can often learn from resources about *acceptance and commitment therapy* (ACT), *cognitive behavior therapy* (CBT), and *dialectical behavior therapy* (DBT).

Among the self-help guides at 7 Cups there is a guide to ACT, and several of the other guides describe techniques related to CBT and DBT.
