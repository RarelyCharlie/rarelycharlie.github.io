# Listening and related techniques

Listening in the wider context of techniques that help people.

#### Dale Carnegie (1936) _How to Win Friends and Influence People_

Classic advice on getting along with people, valuable for listening to members and also for participating in the 7 Cups community. Based on a large collection of illustrative stories. Some of the language and culture is of its time, but human nature hasn't changed. Many later editions, including one "for the digital age".

#### Carl R. Rogers (1942) _Counseling and Psychotherapy: Newer Concepts in Practice_

A very early book about what we now call active listening, explaining where the idea of active listening originally came from, how it helps people, and how to do it. Full of real examples transcribed from recorded sessions. Part IV is a complete transcript of eight hour-long conselling sessions, with comments by the author.

If you're a listener, or thinking of becoming a listener, and if you only read one book from this list, I recommend that this should be the one (Parts I to III, anyway).

#### Michael P. Nichols (2009) _The Lost Art of Listening: How Learning to Listen Can Improve Relationships_

A detailed guide to listening, with many examples. The focus is on real life relationships and family therapy, but many of the listening techniques can be used by listeners at 7 Cups. The focus on relationships is also useful for listeners, because so many members come to 7 Cups with relationship issues.

#### Susan Cain (2012) _Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World that Can't Stop Talking_

An antidote to _How to Win Friends and Influence People_ that explores the many ways in which people can be happy and successful without buying in to groupthink and the currently fashionable extrovert ideal.

{:.links}

#### Paul Graham (2004) _Hackers and Painters_

An insider view of the Silicon Valley culture where 7 Cups grew up. A collection of loosely related essays. Some tech jargon (which you can mostly skim over). Some very techie chapters that you could skim over, but it's worthwhile reading enough to get a flavour of the culture, which explains a lot about 7 Cups.

# Individual stories

Biography and fiction describing mental illness.

#### Robert M. Pirsig (1974) _Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance: An Inquiry into Values_

Weird but very engaging exploration of, amongst other things, the relationship between humanity and technology (which, in a way, is what 7 Cups is about) and the relationship between sanity and madness.

#### Fyodor Dostoevsky (1866) _Crime and Punishment_

Classic tale of madness with terrible consequences, and of recovery through love.

# Psychotherapy

The techniques of psychotherapy, which are mostly based on active listening but go much further. For interest only, especially for listeners considering future training to become therapists. Not intended to encourage listeners to play at being amateur therapists while they are volunteers at 7 Cups!

#### Josef Breuer and Sigmund Freud (1895) _Studies on Hysteria_

Only for historical interest. This book is thought to be the first to describe listening as a treatment for mental illness. In the first of the cases studies in this book, Fräulein Anna O., the patient demanded to talk while Herr Dr. Breuer only listened to her. Thus, "the talking cure" is said to have been invented by this patient, whose real name was Bertha Pappenheim. According to some reports she recovered and became well known as a social pioneer, but aspects of the story have been disputed.

{:.links}

#### Carl R. Rogers (1961) _On Becoming a Person: A Therapist's View of Psychotherapy_

Sets out the basis of client-centered therapy, which builds on active listening and extends it. Some of the philosophy and techniques described could optionally be used by any listeners at 7 Cups who want to go beyind the basics, especially in long term relationships with members, but without attempting amateur therapy.

{:.links}

#### Irvin D. Yalom (2009) _The Gift of Therapy: An Open Letter to a New Generation of Therapists and their Patients_

A fascinating insight into the mind of a very experienced therapist. It shows how psychotherapy (mostly long-term existential therapy and group therapy) builds on the very basic techniques of active listening. 85 short chapters, with little jargon and many anecdotes and quotes.

#### Paul Moloney (2013) _The Therapy Industry: The Irresistible Rise of the Talking Cure and Why It Doesn’t Work_

Well researched and detailed critique of all forms of psychotherapy by an experienced practising psychologist.

{:.links}

#### Danny Wedding and Raymond J. Corsini (2014) _Case Studies in Psychotherapy_

A collection of case studies illustrating different approaches to psychotherapy, with transcripts of actual therapy sessions. The therapists are all experts in their respective approaches, and they explain their thinking as they work with each client.

Unfortunately the CBT case study is not at all like typical CBT (as its author acknowledges).
