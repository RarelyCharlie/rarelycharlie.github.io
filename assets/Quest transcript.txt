what's up guys it's justin khan and you

are listening to the quest

today's podcast is with glenn moriarty

glenn is a psychologist and the founder

of seven cups of tea

seven cups of tea is an app that

provides online therapy and free support

and since glenn founded the company back

in 2013

they've trained over 440 000 listeners

around the world and helped over 50

million people

in our conversation we talked about

founding the company

getting funded by y combinator wellness

startups in general

the ups and downs of glenn's journey the

power of habits

and how to create companies as a

positive force for change in the world

company values and more i love how

mission driven glenn is and also his

honesty

in really coming clean about the

difficulties of building seven cups

as someone who's been in therapy and had

therapy helped me through some

very difficult times in my own companies

i deeply admire the work that glenn's

doing

and i really wanted to highlight someone

using technology to build something

positive for the world

so here is my conversation with glenn

[Music]

so i want to i want to start off with

the origin story of glenn and how you

got to the place where you were starting

seven cups of tea zooming backwards like

how did you

get up to the point where you were you

know you were starting the company

so the the story is like um you know

part of it is

you know growing up having a bit of a

tough you know childhood tough family

experiences and

and i think i think a lot of founders

experience those things and

you know and i think uh i don't know any

real data on it but i think

people are overrepresented who

have been able to endure some level of

pain and get through that and figure

things out and navigate things

um so i think that's just a general

startup

thing you agree with that totally i

agree with that i

found when i was it took actually going

through the entire startup journey and

eventually

becoming successful and then going

beyond that to realize it but

part of my process was i you know in the

last couple years i really realized that

everything i had done in my entire life

was for to get the approval of the

people around me

yeah you know i just wanted the approval

that i didn't feel that i got when i was

a kid you know from my peers

maybe from family members and so

um i mean i had a pretty nice childhood

growing up

in a lot of ways but but that was a

major driving force

in of justin you know in everything i

did

and that manifested itself and for

better for worse right like

you know it served me for for a long

time to be successful

in in some ways but i was also a

mechanism of self-torture

yeah it's self-torture and in enormous

drive

and perseverance and grit and i mean all

of those kind of core

i mean what's that statement somebody

says running a startup is like getting

punched in the face repeatedly

and then somebody else throws a cookie

at you every once in a while and you

just gotta look for the cookies

somebody's heard that that's that's an

amazing one

it's that's what it's like right it's

like brutal yeah so anyways

um so for me um i was you know i i

became a psychologist

to learn how to better help people you

know that's that's really what i wanted

to do and

being a psychologist is you know it's uh

it's a lot of work you go through a ton

of it and then you can like help one

person at a time

really and and the way you scale it is

you do group therapy so you have like

eight people in a room and that's really

powerful i mean there's there's a ton

that can be done with groups and i think

we can get smart and figure that out in

a whole bunch of ways that we that we

haven't yet

um but um i have another company too

it's a

it's a learning an online learning

company and that got me

you know lifestyle business and you know

being okay financially and everything

else

but i was studying uh offline behavior

that hadn't yet moved online so learning

when i was a kid

was entirely offline then i moved online

dating was offline then i moved online

and i was talking to my wife my wife is

a therapist and she was listening to me

it was a startup

problem you know so many of them are and

and i thought

what do people do who are you know

founders

that don't have somebody compassionate

you know to listen to them and i'd been

studying

this was like six months i was studying

offline behavior that hadn't moved

online in like a systematic way for like

six months and

in it i couldn't figure it out and then

that to try to

find a startup problem it's just fine to

start a problem exactly i was just

because i didn't want to i didn't want

to try to create a new behavior

i didn't want to like do something that

wasn't universal i wanted to be like

okay

like learning is universal everybody

wants to learn but like learning is hard

like not everybody loves learning it's

it's

it's too taxing you know this is like

there's all kinds of problems with

learning like

it's just tough whereas yeah i totally

agree i always say that

people say they love learning but they

don't really love learning because

learning involves failing

a lot until you kind of finally get it

yes it's and then it's like much harder

than people think

it's much harder and that's real

learning that's like real life learning

which people hate pain

right it's like that i saw that you had

the uh the ray dalio principles book

uh his thing that uh progress equals

where pain plus reflection equals

progress

right yeah it's like nobody likes pain

but that's how we learn

but but even you know book learning is

hard it's like hey

focus neuronal connections thinking

you know imagining like so so i was

trying to think of something that wasn't

so arduous for humans to do

um that was universal human impulse and

studying all these different things

and then she's my wife's listening to me

and it was like the

you know the clouds parted and it was

like this is it

the need to talk to somebody this is the

universal human behavior

that's offline that hasn't yet moved

online

then we should try to figure this out

and uh

so then i submitted the yc and i was

older i was 36.

um i did not think there was a chance i

would get in at all i stayed up late i

did the you know the little one minute

video thing i could barely keep my eyes

open

uh and uh paul buchheit

read the application and was like this

is a great idea and then i did the whole

i chose the um

the last interview slot and i and i had

a i had a thought like if it goes long

i will think i've got good odds but if

it doesn't go long i'll think i

just blew it and it ended up going like

17 minutes instead of the 10 minutes it

was supposed to go

and i felt really good about it and i uh

i just went downtown

down and then pb called and said hey we

want to offer you a slot i was like oh

my god i can't believe

it um so uh yeah i did yeah

and then we were we were in a

neighborhood with a bunch of uh

navy seal families and um

this was in virginia beach and uh

my wife was friends with all of these

spouses

and um they would go on deployments

and so it was normal for them to be gone

for like six months four months eight

months

and there was like this kind of tight

community of people caring looking out

for one another

and so we just decided to see it as a

deployment uh because i had four kids i

even had a one-year-old

i mean which was oh wow i mean really

yeah um

and so yeah then we went out there and

then they came out for a month in the

middle

but yeah we launched it i was the first

listener my my wife was the second

i could never get enough listeners i was

going to like

you know ucla trying to get people to

listen

and uh so the original model was people

we

just could come on this app and find

someone who would listen to them and

talk about whatever they wanted yeah

what's what's funny is like so as a

psychologist you know you you meet face

to face right so it's like

you it wasn't until a long time into

this that i like realized how

how difficult we were making seeking

mental health support so like from an

internet funnel perspective

right it's like less clicks less

threatening the better

mental health is like 27 steps super

hard steps

and very threatening like come meet with

a stranger fill out all this paperwork

you know do a deep dive in all the

things you don't want to talk about

uh you know call a person drive there

it's

really really tough so then below that

is video conferencing

still intimate but but less threatening

more convenient below that is

voice phone calls and then below that is

anonymous messaging

and so we launched with voice which i

already thought was way less threatening

than all the other stuff

and so we used a thing called um plivo

which was like a twilio

um thing where the the person seeking

help would call

we'd ring all the listeners yeah we had

like i don't know 40 50 at the time

whoever picked up the call would get

connected

and it was voice and what we found was

like

and a half percent of people preferred

messaging over voice because voice was

still too intimate

um right it was still it was like

there's still much too much

you know emotion prosody and voice and

there's too much awkwardness with it

but if you do messaging and you make it

anonymous

then way more people seek help

than than than they otherwise would um

makes sense like nobody wants to call a

restaurant right everybody wants to text

it now everybody wants to order

everything online and

kind of it lowers the friction to human

interaction yeah and that's food like

hey i need some food

it's not like you know hey this is

secret that i've never told anybody and

i just need to get it off my chest

i'm curious did you get pushback from

the community

of you know professional community of

therapists and

psychologists who are saying that this

is you know too easy

or you know it's in a way it's

disruptive to the idea of traditional

mental health

help yeah so fortunately um

we were you know really under the radar

for a long time and in 2013

that was really deliberate on my part

because

the idea then that you could train a

regular person to care for another

person

was was seen as radical now it's not at

all now the scene is like very obvious

like yeah of course why not like just

listening like this isn't hard anybody

can do this it's not hard

like we have all kinds of problems we

should be doing this um but we ended up

adding therapists so we we love

therapists i'm a psychologist i was

nervous we have

over 100 clinicians on the platform so

we see it like a treatment team where

you

you know there are there are volunteer

listeners

there are licensed professionals and

there

there are even chat bots and and

together

that combination of people

can best help people so it's it's not

like

like the uber where it's like hey we

want to kill taxi cabs

um it's more like hey we need you

but you're super talented so you should

be helping the people that really need

it

whereas like if somebody else just has

like a minor boyfriend girlfriend

or you know minor work stress problem

you know we don't want to clog you up

with with these kind of minor issues

where you could be

you know you could be really helping

somebody who's experiencing more

depression

and so that triage process that that's

how we see it so now now

we get no pushback at all um and we

you know we we have a bunch of people

you know in the company that

they're licensed people and i think that

that'll get smarter and better where

it's like right now the the therapists

don't yet work with the volunteer

listeners in that kind of way

or with chat bots in that kind of way

but i think in the future

it'll be much more streamlined and you

know and

we'll be able to help people you know

significantly better because that that

team will be tighter so when you

launched the company

what happened how did it go was it

immediately

you know was the was the audience

immediately receptive

did was it viral or you know did you

kind of have to go through the long dark

night of

nobody using it to figure out how to get

users it's really funny so my first

meeting with

pb um

i was so excited and you know i'd been

working on the home

side and you know because we were gonna

we were gonna help first we were gonna

help

uh parents with special needs kids that

was the original hypothesis

um and uh and they were gonna help

veterans

um and we didn't

build any of that technology to connect

people

and i'm trying to show him the website

and he's like did did you launch this

yet

and i'm like no no no not yet and you

know that fear

right like was probably not going to

work right like that's like i don't know

if this is going to work

it and it's yeah it's

basically like okay we're done thanks

for coming in

launch it and then come back next week

and yeah it was like so you know at the

time it was like oh my god like

but that was you know that was such a

gift like

do it and then learn and i think what a

lot of people don't know is like

most things are not going to work and

you have to just like keep at it and

figure it out so

so we did that and i harassed all my

family members

all my friends hey call this service hey

do this hey do that and that's when we

figured out like the the voice thing was

too much for people they were too

anxious about it

um and then i was sitting on uh i had

this

this apartment right down the street

from yc and

i would just sit on that guy this

horrible couch i bought all my furniture

secondhand

um and i don't even know where i where i

was able to get there was like this

really

horribly looking floral couch and i just

lived on that thing and i would live in

you know reddit chat rooms any kind of

support room

um for like you know

hours all day long just trying to listen

and see how are people that are in pain

what are they trying to do like how are

they doing it and what are they doing to

get out of that pain on the internet

um and what were they doing they're

mostly just like chatting and

you know some of them were chatting in

chat rooms some people were talking on

subreddits there's you know it was like

a lot of mental health subreddits

um different there were different um

like mental health

uh social networks um those were really

the broad

you know the kind of the the kind of

general solutions

um and then i just started inviting some

of those folks

um and then we started getting some we

finally launched

and uh we got a lot of press and because

there was like no

there really wasn't like it there was

not a solution on the internet

to provide emotional support to people

and it was like a novel thing

so then like you know it we got a lot of

press and then like a lot of people came

and

and then that was when the demand

was was so high and i could never get in

front of it i was like super stressed

out

and this guy his name's robin stepdo i

will be

forever in gratitude to him he's an old

english guy was at the

so i called i also at the same time i

called like 200 non-profits

uh in in the bay area none of them

were at all interested in working with

me but but one was

yeah and it was the santa clara nami uh

and this lady kathy forward

and she agreed to meet me for breakfast

and so i i went and i met with her

breakfast and she said this sounds like

a really good idea i like

it why don't you meet my my team of uh

you know peers that provide support for

people struggling with substance use and

families and all this other stuff so i

was like okay awesome

and then they became our first listeners

okay and this guy said you know you know

and especially that time it's like

really all of seven cups it's always

been like a hey we're all in this

together how are we going to figure this

out

and he said you know why don't you put a

little we at that time we had this

rotating banner at the top of the

the chat and he said why don't you put

up a banner that says one of the best

ways to help yourself is to help

somebody else

and so we did that and then all of a

sudden we started getting people to sign

up

you know that that had received help and

so some percentage

and then that helped us finally get in

front of that demand so as more people

came for help

to talk to somebody then some percentage

of those people would turn

into the listeners who would uh talk to

you know

hear listen to people that's exactly

right yeah and then had a skill from

there

and then we had uh one of the main

things is um we were just talking about

this so we just had our birthday

so we had like a community meeting about

our birthday but we had this this

uh group we didn't have our own chat

room for listeners

so what listeners when you're chatting

with somebody you might be might be

tough you might have a question

so you'd have to like go pm you know

private message somebody else to get

help on that and then they'd give you

so then we had a a a third-party app

called chatsy

where it was our first listener support

room and then

uh then that kept crashing because it

was growing too big

and then so then we had to finally build

our own but the community really grew

from

listeners it was really listeners

you know caring for the people that are

seeking help but also caring for one

another and that was like kind of the

heart of the community

and then we build out forums and more

chat rooms and eventually all the other

kind of things that we've got and so

what's been the

impact so far you guys have helped a lot

of people yeah so we've reached

we just updated this for the birthday so

we now have like 427

000 trained volunteer listeners 189

countries providing support in 140

languages

so it's like and we we didn't do

sometimes people say what was your

internal

internationalization strategy and we had

none it's just that

people around the world need help and

support

and some percentage of those folks sign

up to be listeners

so we have this enormous international

volunteer workforce

um so that's the that's that's stat

we've we've sent about 1.3 billion

little over that like 1.3 billion

supportive messages

um and um we've reached about 53 million

people

and so in a lot of parts of the world

you know we we've already reached

somewhere between one to five percent of

the population

and so there's this very cool i i like

to think about like community capacity

so like in these in these able companies

as they evolve

i think a part of it will be um real

accountability around like

things we want to make an impact on like

we really want to help this population

or we really want to tackle this group

and i think eventually we'll see like

shared dashboards on a regional basis

and then people listeners from those

regions

driving the gains across those listeners

and leaders

driving the gains you know across those

uh

those things are trying to make a dent a

dead end that's pretty incredible it's

53 million people around the world

yeah that's um i guess did you ever

imagine that it would

kind of reach that type of scale

i was always really super hopeful you

know i was and

and and it's you know these kind of

conversations always

it and you know it's like they're brutal

right like every game is a you got to

work for the game you got to figure it

out you bang your head up against the

wall and

you get beat up a lot you make a ton of

mistakes take make a ton of significant

mistakes

but i think you just keep evolving it um

so i i remain like we've we've made

tons had tons of problems we still have

tons of problems still have tons of

mistakes but

um i i really want us to build

a really effective free mental health or

emotional support system like that's

what we're really really trying to build

and like with your habit you like your

app

anything that can be impacted by

positive social support and behavior

change

whatever that is heart disease obesity

related disease mental health

we want to be able to make a positive

impact on those things

so if we're if we're actually really

successful and this

this new book you know how innovation

works basically says 15 years

is what it takes to really cook up a a

really good

innovation and so we're seven years and

we're not even halfway there

so if you know it's it's still long odds

still very long odds but like if we can

figure it out you know

we'll be it'll be amazing so what are

the things that are

are left to do for you oh my god there's

tons

dude it's just like tons and tons i mean

you know

matching people up with the best

listeners for them

um like we think about it like

whatever you're struggling with there's

like digital medicines for it

right so like um you know and

the medicines we provide are like

chatting with a listener that's a type

of medicine and and

you know and then chatting with

different types of listeners like you

like you're you would be a great startup

listener

right that's a different type of

medicine um

growth paths we call them growth pastor

treatment plans so like what a clinician

would

if you had panic attacks they would walk

you through a protocol

cbt protocol to help you overcome those

panic attacks so we have like 36

different paths but

there's probably millions of those steps

and they can be reorganized and made

differently we're going to create

something that we call the playlist

where

any kind of expert or other people can

create their own growth path steps on

seven cops

and so they can be voted up voted down

and we'll probably learn a whole bunch

of

interventions that are that are

effective that we didn't even know about

we don't know about now

so that's that's the type of medicine

and then the third type of medicine is

community

just knowing that hey i'm not alone

there's other people like me we're

figuring it out together

so ultimately we want to be able to

say okay here you are this is whatever

you're struggling with

this is these are the right listeners

for you these are the right exercises

for you

this is the right community for you

maybe here's the other

the other you know apps that are in this

kind of consortium that we can recommend

um and then we work together to help you

get real outcomes in your life so you're

happy

uh and you know you you have less

suffering

that's the vision we're we're like 1000

miles from that we're

ten thousand or a million is a long ways

to go is that kind of the primary north

star for the company to reduce

suffering in the world it is yeah it

really is we're trying it

we're trying to decrease suffering

in whatever way we can that's a great

goal

so how's the process of of starting this

company it's been seven years seven

years in

which is once well i once heard that you

know eight years is kind of the average

time it takes to get some sort of

outcome

for her founder that's actually exactly

how long it took us to go from

streaming camera on our head to you know

twitch exit

uh like what have you how's the

experience been of starting this company

and this you know over this time

like what's it been like for you it's

been i mean like we were talking earlier

about the the parenting

is it was super hard early on because

you just didn't know what you were doing

none of the infrastructure was built

you know i in in seven cups is different

it's like not a normal company it's not

like a widget where it's like hey we're

just making widgets and

now we optimize the widgets and now we

increase the acquisition dollars to

increase more widgets like it's just

like it's it's it's a very

unusual

you know like the complex adaptive

system

community like it's a different type of

thing so like

creating you know co-creating with the

community because the community creates

it

along with us you know with the team was

the listeners and the leaders and we're

all trying to

figure it out together um it's been

incredibly challenging

you know like there's there's not many

things like my i had twins that were

born 10 weeks early premature

that was really tough it was really

really tough um you know i've had a

you know a lot of pain in life but i've

never had

uh i've never tried to do anything as

challenging as seven cops like it's just

it's been tough

it's been good it's been really good

i've grown a tremendous amount but it's

been really

you know it's been tough what have been

those those hardest moments or

inflection points for you

i mean i think it's like i remember you

know peop sometimes people say like hey

do you ever use the service yourself

seven cups and it's like oh my god i've

used it so many times you know

especially early on i remember just like

crying like just like

like i would go on and i could never say

like hey

i'm i'm the founder of this thing and

i'm really struggling like i don't know

i don't know how we're gonna make any

money

because what happened was we we built a

thing

uh and we had figured out all those kind

of early elements we had no idea how

we're gonna make any money

and right and i i you know everybody was

sacrificing like

nobody was getting paid market salaries

some people weren't taking a salary like

it was just it was just a tough spot

and in the community thought some there

were some people in the community

thought we were like selling all the

data

or like we had tons of money and

and i at that time was like the you know

i thought

i can't tell them how bad it is i have

to pretend everything's great

you know and you kind of you know be the

be the good leader that's like

you know everything's fine um don't

worry just keep listening

yeah you know right and uh it was just

killing me i mean i was like i just

could not sleep for it just took me

forever

and we would try different things we

tried the we tried monetizing the growth

paths

so upgrade you know you unlock the

depression growth about that

barely move the needle uh and then we

finally figured out online therapy uh

and that worked but before that

i mean it was just super tough it was

just like

like you know we even went with our i

went around with like my my digital hat

in hand you know because at that time it

was like hey

you know just got to get a quarter from

everybody and it was like hey you want

to give me a quarter

okay do you want to give me a quarter

and it was like i don't want to give you

you know i really don't want to give you

a quarter like

you know some people will but like

nowhere near enough um

and so i remember going on the service

and just being like

i have this incredibly challenging

engineering problem

like i would frame it in in ways that

would not make it

obvious that that was seven cops you

know and i

have a lot of people counting on me and

i'm terrified of letting them down yeah

i just

and and then you know again well i guess

why i'm so hopeful

for all these like social challenges we

face you just

incrementally stick at it and

you know you make the gains and it's

brutal and there's a whole bunch of

challenges along the way but

you know you get there eventually um at

least some of the time

and you know maybe maybe enough of the

time uh you know we'll get there and

we'll be able to make a

real dent in some of these challenges

yeah for sure that's

i i found that there's those periods of

you know struggling when i look back on

them i'm

very thankful for them because i you

know they were periods of tremendous

self-growth for me

you know where i like didn't know where

things were what was going to happen

you know i was very worried and that

they weren't all successful i had lots

of companies that

ultimately failed yeah but i still am

thankful for those those periods of

struggle because i

grew a lot and learned a ton from from

them

of course it's easy to say now on the

other side but at the time you know they

seem like often

times it was like the end of the world

was happening and i was the only one

responsible for like everything that was

going on and so many different people

um and i didn't know what what i would

do possibly do if i failed

yeah exactly it will loom so large it's

the only thing you can see

and it is but that's where you grow i

mean that's where the that's where the

person is made right

even then you don't but you don't wanna

it's never fun going through it

so the lesson for anybody out there

who's

starting a company or or um maybe

considering starting a company

what's the seven years encapsulated down

into like the one thing for them i think

it really is that stoic idea that the

problem is the path

it's like you you know i i

the problem the problem is your friends

you don't want the problem

you know there's there's a type of

therapy called acceptance and commitment

therapy

it's really powerful you probably really

like it it's interesting so it's

it's basically this idea that um

problems happen in life

and they they have a metaphor for the

problem it's called

aunt maggie and aunt maggie is your

annoying uh

you know you're you're in your house and

you know she's you know she's knocking

on your door

and you're hiding in the back and you

don't want you know she goes away and

then she comes back and she's knocking

again

louder this time and and you just want

to ignore

[Music]

ignore her he just wanted to go away and

then

but that just complicates things because

the

the the big problems never just go away

so it's like really an

act the goal is you you open the door

say hey

maggie how's it going i don't really

want to hang out or talk to you right

now but i'll tell you what i just made

some lemonades made some iced tea

let's sit down let's have a conversation

tell me about what's going on and then

you know it and then in this and then

you have the whole conversation

and it's horrible and it's painful and

then

she leaves and you know you get like a

little gold nugget you get like some

kind of

wisdom or you get a key whatever the

metaphor is

you you get something really valuable

from solving that problem whether

whether it's personal growth something

for the company

something for other people but it gets

you something and then that's the thing

you need

for the next level you know like if it's

like a video game it's like then you're

inside

that key and then of course you're on

the next level

and now maggie comes back again you're

right and it's like but maybe it's

different not but she's you know it's

even more annoying and even more

problematic and even more challenging

and then you you know unlock that but

that idea that you know when you're

taking like a water or soda bottle

you know if you go to like a 7-eleven

and you take the first one the next one

slides down

i think the the problem is the path idea

whether it be personal life

or and this is all principal stuff too

but

you know whether whether it's startup

business

relationships kids whatever that next

biggest problem is

if you just face it and you do your best

to try to solve it

that becomes the path and if you're

successful

you know you're blessed with another

problem like the next one comes sliding

down at you

and then you just do that and um from an

evolutionary perspective or like an

annie fragile perspective

i think that's how you really evolve and

you're a person navigating life or your

company

navigating the market that it's in or

whatever i think that's how you evolve

and grow the the capacities needed

to better navigate personal life or the

market or

being a dad or whatever

that's beautiful just take everything

one problem at a time

i think so i mean this is probably very

not a

popular idea but i i think it's how we

grow

you know i think a lot of the the issues

that we tackle and starts are very

daunting right like you the idea of like

how do you create this

big company or giant system or fulfill

your obligations to investors and

um i always thought about if i

am faced with a problem i don't know how

to how to deal with or solve just how do

you break it down into component pieces

and then

you know break that down into smaller

pieces and just find the smallest

increment of work that you can do small

smallest problem you can tackle and then

just

do that first yeah and then once you do

that then figure out the next one and

and in that way you know kind of build

up momentum for yourself

in tackling things that can be

ultimately very difficult challenges

yeah i think that's really well said and

you build the muscles it's like you

don't

they can be just like these enormous

things but yeah if you can break them

down it's like well i can do that

and i can do that i can do that and then

eventually maybe it's

you know mostly solved you don't have

any kids right

i have one you do have a 10 month oh

congratulations i didn't know that

okay boy or girl it's a boy oh awesome

there's julius oh

awesome okay so let's say julius let's

say

20 years from now know we're

you know my son's 15 he's already

thinking about this stuff so maybe 15

years from now

um julius is uh wants to do a startup

uh

what's what's the what's the thing that

you would say

hey this is the best thing about this

and then

was it and then and then what would be

the hey this is the worst thing about

this

and you really gotta you gotta be ready

for the worst thing

and and i'm kissing the best thing too

this is the best thing you could be good

but you should also be mindful of this

yeah so the best thing i think the best

thing is clearly that

it's such a vehicle for your own

self-growth and self-awareness

you know and self-discovery for my you

know all the things i've realized

about how i show up in the world

what i struggled with all the behavioral

patterns

that i had carried on from when i was a

kid that were formed when i you know

when i was younger

all those things i realized through the

pain

of various stressful situations in

startups that's the best thing

and then obviously there's a lot of if

you're successful there's lots of

you know nice things in society that you

get uh from it but

i i would say that's actually secondary

the

bad part the painful part is going

through that experience

right like there is human beings like

you said flinch away naturally from pain

and there are a lot of painful

experiences you know i

shut down a company recently and laid

off 180 people that was very painful you

know i

had to face a lot of my own demons

around

failure uh in that moment and and

letting people down

um there are experiences where you feel

like you're not gonna

meet payroll or you're you know the site

is down and you know that

there are people counting on it for

their own help

right like to to be connected with other

people and

you're you know there's a technical

failure and things

shut down and you're like oh my god this

is the end of the world this feels like

the world is ending and you know that's

that's the downside of a startup so

you know they're kind of it's two sides

of the same coin in a way those

those painful experiences are what drive

the growth but you also have to go

through those painful experiences

and that's the best and worst part of

starting a company yeah it's it's it's

the

it's it's really interesting when you

said the the the personal growth part

um it's like what i when you were saying

um it made me think of like almost like

like echoes right like the like reality

is bouncing off of you and you're like

learning about yourself through the way

the pattern of reality is like

the experiences are unfolding and

hitting you and then you have to kind of

like

learn and go through them and listen to

what it's

what is the message kind of life is

sending you at that time

yeah it's

it's an accelerated journey from what

most people get to experience

you know most people experience um

stressful situations and painful

experience situations

they just don't experience them every

day or every week

and so you have this accelerated journey

which which does

put you on a path that i think can be

incredibly

um meaningful you know and and where you

where you can learn a tremendous amount

that you wouldn't be able to but it

you know once you're on the roller

coaster it's really hard to get off

yeah so so that's like i i think the

secondary question then would be like

like hey you're going to grow in an

excel

your your personal growth your your

overall growth but your personal growth

is gonna go through this accelerator

you're gonna you're gonna live lifetimes

in years if you and i think that's a

nice way of saying it like the number of

stressful

scenarios like if you have a normal

nine-to-five job

you know you're not getting nailed

frequently hopefully

but then start up you're getting nailed

frequently so

so then what do you say to help julius

through that well to some extent

on one hand you know one of my favorite

books is his book siddhartha

um and in the book i don't know if

you've read it it follows the life of

siddharth as he goes

you know through life and my favorite

part in it in the book is

eventually you know he has a kid and he

uh becomes a at the end of his life he's

like a

river like a fairy man he like varies

people back and forth across the river

and he

has a friend who's a fairy man and this

kid is now starting to experience life

and becoming an adult and making all

these mistakes

and he said our that asks his friend

he's like how can i prevent my kid from

making mistakes

these mistakes and this his friend is

like that's part of the process you know

he has to you can't prevent him

you have to go out there and he has to

go learn for himself

and i think in a way that's kind of how

i feel about startups

you know whether it's my own son or not

he will have to learn

himself that's kind of the point of the

startup but it really

applies to anything you do in life in

your your entire journey and so

there's nothing really i can do to ease

it um at the same time

you know i think that what i would tell

him is probably what i've been talking

about a lot

uh publicly recently which is that you

know just having a healthy base of

um personal wellness behaviors will

allow you to have the anti-fragile

enough

to tackle on the these problems and have

these emotional swings and experience

these like ups and downs that you

that you have when you're tackling any

sort of heart problem whether it's to

start up or not

and so those are things you know like

meditation and exercise and diet

which help you um

be grounded in yourself and i think

avoid the worst

outcomes of like the compulsive

compulsive behaviors

and addictions of being a human being

yeah

and so if you can build that set of

practices and

and give yourself that healthy base i

think you're you're best suited to

tackle

any of life's problems yeah so feel kind

of like

make sure you're fueled up and continue

to fuel up with healthy nourishing

energy and resources so that you can get

through

um absolutely because the temptation

will

those things and those are things that's

really good so it's like

hey before you start this journey

spend six months it's it's interesting

it's like almost like a pre-elective

right so like you're gonna go into a

startup you're gonna take the startup

course

hey spend six months developing some

really good habits and get really

healthy

uh i because you're gonna that's

interesting yeah you know

it's kind of like a personal um

performance

you know optimization in a lot of ways

like when you are an athlete right like

you're a star athlete you're

what a tennis star basketball star

you're lebron james right or like tom

brady right these guys don't just

practice basketball or play basketball

they also have

you know wellness and dietitians and

massage therapists and like they have

like 20 people full time who help them

be at their best be at their most

optimal now you might not need a staff

of 20 people or be able to afford it or

if that might not make sense but there's

probably a lot of baseline

activities that you should be doing that

will keep you ready to

you know well you know at your peak

performance to tackle whatever it is

that's

that's coming up for you and i think

that really applies to everybody really

in you know all aspects of life

yeah yeah definitely yeah we find

ourselves in these situations where

we're so

stressed um in in daily life and we're

so busy

and we think oh i don't have time to

meditate i don't have time to eat

healthy i just need to eat something

quickly

i i don't have time to exercise

and there's some truth to that people

are very busy and the modern modern life

keeps us

super busy and keeps us on this

treadmill but i think of those things as

an investment

you know if you're investing even just

five minutes a day of exercise

you you're going to get that five

minutes back i guarantee it right

um yeah if you invest five minutes in

meditation you're gonna get those five

minutes back you know you're gonna get

the value

you're gonna and you're gonna see that

value and so

uh you know i think that that's just

part of a real a really important part

of

being grounded and well in your own

experience

yeah it's funny it's like when you go

through yc right like they tell you like

exercise and sleep well right but it's a

it's really what you're saying is like

level that up a fair amount

like get your get your tank

you know your your emotional tank your

well-being take your wellness tank

get it so that it's high just regularly

and so when you're taxed you know it

goes down it goes down 20

but your your habits the practices

you've already been developing

grow it back up again and then so you're

going to keep getting hit

in life like you know football players

you're going to keep getting hit

but like you know heal recover get

stronger again he'll recover and get

stronger again

now my meditation teacher talks about a

window of tolerance

and that's like the experiential things

you know the

uh the things you experience in life

that that are happening and like what is

within your window of tolerance that's

stuff that you can metabolize and deal

with and then things that will are

outside

you know maybe they're too extreme just

extreme pain or there's you know

emotional

discomfort that are just outside of your

window of tolerance and kind of

you know then you get you get uh

frazzled and you kind of like get

triggered and go off the rails um

and i think about it is like by doing

these healthy things you're increasing

your window of tolerance

you're able to deal with with someone

more and i can see that you know and

anyone can do this experiment

pretty easily it's like you go to the

next time you know

the next time that you are experiencing

some sort of stress

there are things you can directly do to

um

to mitigate that you know but like for

me it's exercise like if i'm going

through something where i'm

feeling sad and my experience or

depressed or stressed or angry

if i go and immediately do just five

minutes of cardiovascular exercise i

will feel

a lot different um yeah and that's

that's a you know worthwhile investment

to me

yeah the resetting of the brain with

exercise is just insanely powerful

it feels like we're it's like we're kind

of gradually

unwillingly accepting the power of that

but yeah i do the same thing with with

stress too it's like you can be super

stressed and you just

go for a run and i come back and it's

like okay things are fine

like it's not great but you know i can

figure it out or we can figure it out

yeah there's a biological reason for

that right like you have your brain

has an amygdala it evolved to keep you

safe right and

create this fight-or-flight response and

hormones that come that

that are emitted when you are in

situations that where you feel like

you're being attacked

that's natural that's human nature and

you can't fight against it and you

shouldn't

want it to be different that's part of

the experience of being a human being

um and so when you are when you actually

do something physical some sort of

physical activity you're

enabling yourself to like move past this

to release those hormones and and

move beyond and go back to your like

neutral natural

non-triggered state i think that window

of tolerance is a cool idea too it's

like

in and i think with startups you can

certainly get knocked out of your window

of tolerance right it's like yeah and

it's like how do you how do you get back

and that

that scott belski idea of the messy

middle have you seen that

no it's really smart so he he talks

about you know that whole like

that whole like k great idea traffic

sorrow and then you like kind of figure

it out as it goes up

you know you know he's he has this idea

that gets the middle

and it looks like you know it's up down

up down up down but you're going up

uh you're you're on the trend line up

but the downs every down is painful

and so his point is optimize the ups

and then endure the downs because you're

gonna go back up again but just endure

them

um and i think that's an insightful idea

so like with the window of tolerance

it's like

every down like laying people off it's

brutal it's really hard

it's down but you you just kind of kind

of endure and get through it and then

you kind of go back up again and there's

like you lose a major client or

get in a fight or whatever it's like all

those downs and then your

your capacity i think um

yeah it does definitely grow stronger in

your ability to to better manage things

well you know what i found i'd like one

of my my i guess

tropes or um ex things i've struggled

with my entire

life is like how do i connect more

deeply with the people around me i

always long for human connection with

the people around me and i

kind of like didn't know how to get it

and in the past couple years i've really

learned

about you know being approaching people

with a curious mindset and being

vulnerable

and how that drives human connection and

to me

that's you know maybe a little bit the

more interesting thing than

like i used to be in the world of ideas

of like what are you doing like what

what are the cool things you're doing

what you know what's your startup

whatever

and now that i'm connecting a little bit

more on a human to human level i think

that's

that's kind of what i want to make this

about yeah i saw your fee i read your

feeling good uh

uh post and you're kind of um letting

your mind

letting yourself naturally compliment

people observe things about them

highlight things

and that's incredibly unusual right like

people don't do that but it

it creates that connection yeah it's

it's kind of weird that it's unusual

right because in our

society where we i mean we have

everybody's out here longing for human

connection with other people the people

around them we have the most depressed

society that we've ever had i mean

you've known this better than i do yeah

we're people are surrounded by people

and and have so many mechanisms and

means of communication with the people

around them

and yet we feel as more isolated than

ever yeah it's

true why is that yeah it's almost like

we don't we're not we don't learn we're

not taught and we don't focus on the

skills

that help us connect with the people

around us yeah i think that's 100 right

man

and yeah it's not just this thing it's

it's not even really just the social

skill development it's like we're

talking about it's like all those

systems that are

we just don't have the space to to

connect

in a lot of ways and and we don't have

the scaffolding or the skills to do it

either

yeah i want to double click on that

actually like how do you think that

happens like how do we why where do are

we

lacking the space to connect with the

people around us

um i think you know i was this is funny

i was so we can edit this out if this is

but i was i was thinking about you know

i was telling my wife about you and you

know your

your story and the the new app and um

how you had said you know you

you you kind of got to the end of the

road and it just wasn't that interesting

um you know maybe it was interesting for

a little while but then to stop being

interesting

um and it just wasn't nourishing and

then all these other things are like

really nourishing

and so i was trying to figure out like

what is the

how do we consolidate um

because you know i don't think it's like

completely designed

i think a lot of it's unintentional but

we find ourselves not in a great place

uh as humans right as humanity and

so i was trying to figure out what is

the right what is like a simple

framework

to to kind of diagnose the global

problem

and then what is the what is the simple

framework that might highlight new

systems

um so i spent like

i don't know the morning thinking about

that uh

to try to consolidate it um and i don't

know if it's great or not but it's uh

it's it's like an mvp of kind of like

the beginning of an idea around it i

think

so what is it i want to say so the basic

ideas is like um

the the the broader the

the first part is like hey there's all

these surpluses right so right right now

in your life you have a

a surplus of let's call it

it's wisdom right so you because not

many people have

done all that you've done

and and and and of the people that do

almost nobody talks about it honestly

right you see

glimpses like i remember at yc

and you know they they bring the folks

in every week and some of the

some of them are folks that are

successful in the past some are people

that are successful

you know now and sadly some some of the

folks

and i remember this is 2013 i remember

sitting there it's like

you're a bill you're a billionaire

and you're sad and it's like in and you

know yourself kind of blows the mind

it blows the mind it's like how it's

like how can you have

this magnitude of success

and and and what was even worse about it

was

you could hear them comparing themselves

with other people

still it's like the relative wealth

thing

like yeah i have five million dollars

but i'm poor because all my friends have

10 million

it's like i've been this successful but

i feel bad about myself because i'm not

that successful

and no one ever believes it will apply

at the next phase of their

wealth or success exactly yeah yeah it's

like a terrible video game right it's

like

no keep playing keep playing keep

playing um

but anyways you have this you have what

i'm saying is you have

it's wisdom but it's it's a discreet

form of

startup wisdom doesn't quite capture it

because it's broader than that

but it's it's a so that is your surplus

now there are a few people that have

that surplus and now you're using this

podcast so there's a bunch of people

like me and other people

that are in the startup or business or

entrepreneurial life life game

and we have these open questions we have

these needs these

these these ideas and you're connecting

your

startup wisdom surplus with

founders so you're building a bridge

between those things

and it's free it's at no cost and

and i think so when you think about this

societally there are surpluses all over

the place

so like wikipedia i think is the best

example right shirky

clay shirky called it the cognitive

surplus you have all these

very smart people that have mastery of

all kinds of content domains

and then you have all these people

asking questions and looking for

information

and so wikipedia was a bridge that

unlocked the cognitive surplus

uh habitat for humanity you have a

carpentry surplus if people that need

homes

you have a carpentry surplus and you

match up the carpentry surplus with the

people that need homes and you get homes

um aa you know people that are uh

further along the path of

coping with alcoholism people that are

just starting the path and you unlock

that surplus of helping people

um i think there's all like the i was

just talking to the friend ryan he was

talking about the

the app that um you know people that can

see

so somebody's you know who's blind can

say hey help me see this and then they

you know put put the app around so

there's a vision surplus there's like

all these

amazing surpluses but

this the the systems we have are not

lined up

to unlock those surpluses and match them

up with the people who have the needs

well in a way the internet is kind of

like that right the internet is that

connectivity layer that has

allowed all of these marketplaces for

various surpluses to get

to create liquidity around the surpluses

like ebay is an example where people can

you know have a bunch of stuff their

attic they can sell it other people who

want it can buy it and that was a

marketplace that never existed before

100 i think that's i think it's exactly

right and it's like

so the so the um the the goods are the

services that are free

and really helpful to solving other

people's problems i think

in terms of these new systems i think

that's the liquidity

that we need to open up uh right and

we're in the process of discovering new

marketplaces to release unlock liquidity

yes yes so the yeah so so to get to the

the this the

my attempt at some kind of framework on

this was what if we think about

team humanity uh and what if we're under

like some kind of ddos attack

right so like the the in the d the first

d is denial

so we're like in kind of collective

denial about the magnitude of our

challenges

and in the mental health space you know

we've always been in kind of denial

about

how many people are struggling but you

know now it's even more so and

you can really look at any kind of part

of the world you know

obesity depression rate suicide rates

like like

there's a racism there's a lot of signs

that things are not good

right yeah so we're but we're kind of in

denial about it

and then the the second d is like

division

like we're we're fighting with each

other

when really we need to be coming

together to work together to solve these

problems

uh the o is depression uh there's

all kinds of oppression a lot of groups

are oppressed a lot more than others

but very few humans are are flourishing

right there's just like not a lot of

people you can point to and say this

person's doing great like there's

there's a lot of people that are

struggling and then the s and this is

probably the most controversial

is um sociopathy and it's small

there's like you know uh you know

sociopaths are are overrepresented in

some leadership circles

and let's say 97

of leaders are not sociopathic and

they're you know they're really good

people they're kind

everything else but there might be some

percentage of people

that have less remorse and empathy that

are

you know leveraging having more of an

impact

uh in a negative way and

and they might not in and then there

might even be systems

that are set up that have more

you know predatorial outcomes than than

our

designed on purpose but just kind of

evolve that way

and so like you think about like the

food industry

so like we have a obesity epidemic in

the u.s

and it's like okay everybody only has

one stomach

but we need to grow the number of

stomachs so

we make all this food that's addictive

to to get people the equivalent of two

stomachs

and and i don't think there's like a you

know an evil character in kellogg's

you know right the evil mastermind who's

saying this is the way to like increase

obesity in the world it's just a natural

incentive due to

the way humans are exactly exactly and

sorry go ahead yeah one of one of the

core kind of ideas

behind i guess the way i want to live

now is

is that you know human beings are

running this model

in their heads from a resource scarce

environment right like you know

you when in the resource scarce

environment of like humans involved in

you wanted as much food as possible

especially calorically dense

you know um food and so sugar is like

amazing right if you can get sugar you

want to eat as much of it as possible

um in the resource rich environment like

resource abundant

environment that no those running that

algorithm doesn't make sense anymore but

we're still running it and so

that's why you have this you know

incentive to

put sugar in everything and then um

you know people get make up that you

have this massive obesity epidemic

yeah absolutely and i think it's it's

not really it's

yeah it's not a it's not an incentive

it's an incentive problem but it's not

it's not malevolent it's a it's kind of

not something that's naturally evolved

and

and the consequence of everybody running

this outdated algorithm

um and then you know having this

emphasis on short-term thinking

yeah 100 and i think you can make that

argument in a whole bunch of domains

where things are hoarded

you know not not just right like it was

a sure it was a shortage

you know so information would be another

one with you know twitter and facebook

and

you know information used to be scarce

there wasn't a lot of it you wanted to

know

everything that was going on around

around you and then now you know there's

infinite

information and it's very addictive and

so you can get lost down the you know

rabbit hole in in the twitter sphere and

all of a sudden you're

you know posting trump memes

natural evolution of human beings right

right exactly

so so that so that's the so to get to

your point like why are we struggling

with our connection

i i think it's because there's like i

think we're under like some

you know intentional unintentional it's

a multi-variable

problem it's but we're under like a sort

of ddos attack

and then i think we have to like begin

to figure out

systems like can in like seven cups like

others

that that are different that

that provide new ways of kind of

combating that and growing

more healthy responses and so my my

acronym for that is able

able organization so they're aware so

like we're not in denial

about our problems yup we be we build

new systems because

i'm not terribly bullish on our ability

to overhaul the old systems

um we lead with humility and humility

doesn't mean weak

you know humble people are actually

really strong it

it just means you're you know you're

you're listening you're

you're aware you're you're realizing you

don't know everything

and i think the last point is e so able

and e

is um we expect more from one another

i think uh humanity pre

uh you know it's like we're almost like

kids and we want these big institutions

to be our parents and save us

and it's like they're not gonna save us

you know so it's like we it's up to us

to figure out and design new systems

and and really go the extra mile and

help one another

to begin to solve these challenges so

that was my attempt

at uh you know after our conversation

and thinking about

ways to um capture maybe a

an attempt at a framework to say like

was it was kind of a good way of

understanding the global problem

and then what are some ways of maybe uh

trying to solve it in a different way

i like that i like that it puts the

agency you know on ourselves

to make a change in in the world and

sometimes i feel like it's um almost

like a hopeless or like a very daunting

task right to to you know you have all

this momentum

uh for humans and human society think

you know thinking very short term and

running this outdated algorithm that you

can't really change right you can't

reprogram the human brain

well you can but it takes a long time

and a lot of effort versus this like

kind of natural

instinctive programming um and it seems

a very daunting task to change

but having having that

framework maybe is a good first step to

having agency to feel like you can make

a change in the world

well i think with startups like i mean

if you think about twitch or really

anything else like

i think a lot of people that are not

involved in startups they don't know

the process of optimizing something like

that's kind of a secret right it's like

how do you take

you walking around with your camera on

your head

right with justin tv and then to

to a billion dollar company like there's

a

there's ten thousand optimization steps

in there probably more maybe a hundred

thousand maybe three hundred thousand

optimization steps

so it's like yes it seems all these

global problems we have

they seem like there's no way there's no

combination of variables there's no

steps there's no metric board there's no

there's nothing we can do to optimize

and address those changes it's like

look if if a kid can take a video camera

on his head

you don't know how old you were when you

started and yeah 23 years old 23

and that can evolve into that

odds are we can figure out a lot of

stuff

if if we're working together

so there's been a lot of negativity

around

the startup ecosystem i think from the

outside world as some of these companies

have become

giants you know like the ubers and

amazons and facebooks of the world

and people have uh maybe latched on to

some of the downside consequences of

these

companies becoming really big very

quickly um do you still think that

startups are the the solution to some of

humanity's biggest problems

i think the vehicle of a startup is

incredibly powerful i i mean i just i

when you think about types of ways

humans organize

right like so you've got governments

you've got

universities you've got religions

you've got non-profits you've got

corporations different type of

corporations

you know it and some of the and all of

those are yeah

i think in all those things there are

there's tons of powerful ways that

humans organize

um but the startups

the yc particular

training or whatever you want to call it

uh way of thinking i think is

is pretty powerful and and i think you

can anchor

those systems so like the the startup is

it's just a framework it's just a

mechanism the the values that you anchor

it to

or the things that you commit it to will

drive the trajectory

startups themselves are a little amoral

very more and like it's an amoral it's

just a

framework and uh people forget that they

tie

the startup framework with maybe some of

the negative outcomes they see

but when really it's you know the

startup framework can be applied to any

value set starting

value set or problem space that you're

you're trying to tackle 100

so if you've and that's where i think

that that's where i think like the money

thing can get

a little complicated if if if the drive

is towards constant shareholder growth

for more and more money

greater and greater revenue in terms of

the

you know these idea of able companies

these new ways of

unlocking liquidity uh with people that

have got

it i don't know if revenue first can be

the driver

so in the in the value set of a startup

design

to do social good in that way

i don't know if revenue first that's a

that's a strong anchor and there's in

that is the

you know there's an ocean there are

several oceans behind that

so so to design it differently

i don't think that could be the first

thing in that process so it's weird it's

like

it's like a startup vehicle that's not

revenue first

right i was i was actually talking to

brian chesky from airbnb about this

a couple maybe a couple months ago where

he was

very interested in are there new ways to

design a corporation where you are

putting other stakeholders first

you know or maybe not first but like

even considering the needs of other

stakeholders right now it's your

fiduciary responsibility as a

you know executive of a company ceo of a

company to try to increase stake

shareholder value as much as possible

that's your job and you're actually

obligated to do it

and so um this question was kind of at

a corporate level was there were there

ways to uh

i guess right and bake into the charter

of the company that you are going to um

consider different stakeholders

and i think that's a really interesting

question i do too and i think the

problem you're trying to solve like for

me in mental health

i don't think you can solve it but i

don't i don't think you're gonna make an

enormously

big mental health company by being

revenue first

because i think a lot of what you're

focusing on is helping people that are

suffering human suffering

and so i don't think the route

is you know like

like there's a lot of online therapy

companies which are great and we do

online therapy too

but like we're not gonna there there's

not enough clinicians in the world

to to solve all the challenges

uh there's there's just there's too much

demand and there's not enough people

that that want to become psychologists

or social workers or therapists or

counselors to do that

so you have to work with a you know a

very big volunteer you have to train

regular folks to help one another out

in order to do that so i i think there's

ways to justify that and say

if you want to make a really significant

impact in the world

and have a big organization or a big

company

you have to do those things in different

ways so like chesky

the first airbnb state that was at was

at yc

awesome lady her name was carol um

she had a little house in mountain view

she was a single mom it was it was like

completely unusual to me like i'd never

done it before

she wasn't home when i got there you

know

and it was great the next morning we got

up to she had breakfast and it was like

it you could see immediately this was a

lady who was struggling

to make ends me and here was a you know

she had an extra bedroom and she was

able to

like so i don't know i i think in his

model there are a lot of people that

he's

that he's helping where they're helping

you know it's a giant i know it's a

giant company now

that they're helping that could be you

could probably make a relationship

between

this is how i'm helping all these

individuals and this is how it's also

good for the bottom line

right right so do you think um then i

would ask like do you think

it you have to enshrine it in a

corporate document or does it

is it sufficient that you have values as

an organization

that uh you know put

certain stakeholders first right like

one of the big

values in yc companies is like talk to

your customers right like they build for

your customers

that's something that uh paul graham

when he started yc

was you know kind of enshrined in like

you beat the drum of like talk to your

customers to every yc company and that's

really

part of ethos now and many of you know

almost all yc companies that are

successful

start by really trying to provide a lot

of value to their customer base

um do you think that's sufficient or do

you need something else right to make an

able company do you need to do some

other set of things in the beginning

i don't think all of this is super

intuitive and i don't think it's all the

way figured out yet

so i think any kind of

uh i i mean i think it's excellent to

have your values down and have them be

real

like real like actually real and then

have your customers

you know or your users or for in our

case our community

like they can really call you on it if

it's not real so

i i think it's more like like yes

definitely explicitly

identify all those things in whatever

ways you can

but then i think it's like really create

the culture

that is those things like the culture

uh is the implicit outworking

like so like they you know you have this

you have this kind of wisdom now that's

a part of you you've earned it

like it's integrated into the fabric of

who you are you're not all of a sudden

gonna start behaving in a way that's

anti-what we've been talking about

because it's in you and so i think in

the culture of the

the company and in the team and the

people and the community and the clients

there has to be like an ecosystem where

it's like

these ideas are not like on a wall

they're they're like in our hearts right

they're a lived

set of ideals and and values and i think

that

often for my observation is that younger

founders or new founders

um are are too busy they don't focus on

that in the beginning right they don't

enshrine a specific set of values

they're not thinking

uh exactly like what kind of company do

we want to build

um they're just thinking of survival

they're like okay i want to build a

company that exists

right like that's almost you know the

primary thing in their minds that they

care about

which you know makes sense in a lot of

ways because you might not have the

luxury of of the mental space to think

about the future you know

some of the times when you're you're

starting startup and

the consequence of that is that the

values enshrined in the company

are random right they're the values that

maybe they're

they're their own personal values or

their those of their co-founders and

early employees

and some of them are probably good and

some of them are maybe not so good um

but that those types of behaviors

and priorities get perpetuated

throughout the existence of the company

and eventually

you know very quickly actually it

becomes too late to change it right it's

uh

you your you know nimble speedboat has

become a cruise ship

in terms of the direction that you're

heading and um on

from a values perspective it's very hard

to change and try new values

and so you the companies end up with

values that are representative of

kind of this early accident some of

which are usually pretty

pretty good if the company's successful

um and many of which may

not be very deliberate i think that's a

great metaphor

yeah and then you you end up yeah and

then it's like too big to change

like you can't adjust it and it's

yeah and it's and i'm sure upon

reflection and i think it's a very good

point like

i think of seven cups a lot like a child

like i've got four kids i've

you know you know my youngest um just

turned eight

seven cups just turned seven um which is

oh you know old

from from this kind of perspective but

um it's like

early on it is like a kid in the sense

that you're just

you know you're not sleeping you're just

trying to keep the wheels on the thing

you know and

like you can't you it's hard to have the

bandwidth to be able to think about

those higher level things

in that but yeah i think it i think it

is super important to do it

the kid metaphor is probably right

because i think a lot of parents

you know want to do their best but

they're so busy with

the you know day-to-day working at your

job and

trying to make ends meet that it's easy

to maybe

do things that are short-term you know

good like give your kid the ipad or

something

to like entertain themselves

when you wouldn't if you had more time

in space you might not want to make

those choices

that might lead to like downstream

consequences when the kid is

5 8 10 years old or an adult

so how can you help people make those

trade-offs differently

like when you're you know especially in

a startup you know you're you're

you might want to have think about your

values but you might be too worried

about like are you going to be able to

make payroll next month

yeah there's an interesting exercise you

can do with individuals have you ever

done this

end-of-life exercise where you imagine

yourself at your funeral

have you ever done this oh i have i

don't know if it's a

i've done it not necessarily i didn't

hear about the exercise

from anyone else but about a year ago i

thought about my i actually read this

book by frank ostassky called um

oh man i'm blanking on the name of the

book but he was a

um ran the sf zen hospice for 20 years

and sat with like over a thousand people

dying

and then this was all the things he

learned from the dying

um i read the book and i was very moved

by the book and i

it made me think about like what would i

what would i think of when i was dying

what would i who would i

want to see and what would i tell them

and i actually went through the process

of writing it out

and i went and to most of those people

and i just said hey this is what i

i was thinking about my own death

eventually and

what i would say and who would who do i

want to see and what i would want to say

to them

and uh you were on the list and here's

here's what i want to tell you i said i

thought why would i

want to wait until i die that's super

terrifying

i might as well just tell it to you now

and so you know for a lot of people was

i love you and i'm grateful for your our

relationship

um for some people was i'm sorry that

i've let you down

in these ways um but it's really a

meaningful exercise for me i don't know

if that's where you were i don't know

but i think that's an awesome idea i

mean if you ever wanted to write that up

and share that i think that's novel i've

not heard that

it's almost like a lot of people wait to

give all their money away until they're

dead

right and it's like you're giving away

emotional money

right like interpersonal kindness like

like maybe i would write a maybe you'd

write a letter

like my mom wants to write a book that

we give you know she gives to the

grandkids

but like yeah you're just saying like

there's no reason for me to wait

there's gonna give it to you now yeah

absolutely

i think it's a good thing yeah that's a

very cool idea um and i've not heard of

that

this this exercise is where you are

you're

dead so you it's like a whole hypnotic

process but it's like you know okay

you're driving down the street um you

see

you know your family and friends uh you

know they're all parked along the side

of the road they're going into a

building

you're curious they can't see you for

some reason but you can see them they

look sad they're all dressed in black

you go to the building you follow them

down this long corridor

take a left you go into a room there's

all kinds of people there you walk down

the center aisle

um and there's a casket in the front and

you look on the casket and it's you

and you're 80 90 100 110 however do you

imagine you're gonna be when you die

so you're like wow this is really

curious i'm i wonder what's going to

happen so you take take a seat

and then you know your partner if you've

got one comes up and says four things

about you

uh if you've got kids one of your kid

comes up and says

three or four things about you a

co-worker says three or four things

about you

and um some some kind of non-profit or

impact organization you're involved with

they come up and say four things about

you

and the idea is that this is your

compass in life

so rather than the clock which is like

you know the tyranny of the urgent

whatever is urgent we're scrambling

which is like i think we're talking

about being a startup

but in your own personal life this is if

you live

if you begin with the end of mind and

you say

and i think a lot of this is stephen

covey stuff but if you end up

if you say this is where i'm going

this is what i want people to say when i

die you're gonna have a pretty

meaningful and fulfilling life along the

way

and and it kind of helps course correct

you it you know it's like a compass

where it's like okay hey

i'm i'm over here and i'm making a ton

of money or whatever

or now i'm uh i'm getting accolades but

it's like

that's no i don't care if at my funeral

anybody's gonna say

he made the most money he made the most

money you know or whatever

it's a big deal like none of that

matters so it's like can you can kind of

get back on you know back on track so

it's almost the equivalent of

that for a company it's like not that

you're dead

but like let's say you're ultimately

successful

what do you want and i don't know who

the stakeholders would be

but what do you want you know you

you sell the company or it's it's maybe

maybe it's better like it's it's a fully

mature

high functioning company and it's it's

everything that you imagine it to be

you know what do you what do these

people say about it

you become a fortune 500 company what do

the employees say what do the customers

say what do people write about in the

press

all of those things yeah what are the

people who love you say what are the

people who don't love you say

yeah you know that's that's interesting

that's a fascinating exercise

it's it's it's really good i've done it

a bunch of times i've done it i did it

with people on my team and

uh other parts of life and it's just

anchoring

because it's so easy you know in a

startup or just like in life in general

to be

running running running running running

and

and not have that space to reflect i

want to try that actually if i like

organizationally i think that's an

interesting organizational exercise i'd

love to i'd love to try as i

you know think about new or build new

organizations or you know starting off

with that it

seems like uh i mean it can't hurt yeah

it can't hurt

yeah yeah and it doesn't it seems pretty

low risk

yeah hey thanks for this awesome

conversation it was really good uh

talking with you thanks for taking the

time thanks for telling helping me tell

my story thanks for telling your story

and for continuing to do this so that

other people can hear

stories that uh i think provide a map

permission freedom

humility uh and and uh

courage thanks glenda thank you for

for being here and being so open with me

that's a lot of fun

this was awesome okay that was my

conversation with glenn moriarty

i hope you guys liked it one of the

things i really loved about our

conversation was how mission

mission-driven glenn is in building

something

impactful for people in the world it's

really a fundamental human need to be

listened to

and something that we've all experienced

and i personally am really fascinated by

ways that we can use what we've learned

in building technology

especially apps that can help people

with wellness and positive behavior

change on a daily basis

this is something that i'm really

interested in i think there's this huge

opportunity to improve human life

through tech

on an unprecedented scale today but

really only if we focus on it

and so i'd love to encourage more

entrepreneurs out there to do so

so i hope you guys enjoyed the podcast

if you like it you know the drill

rate is 5 stars on itunes and you can

hit me back

at justincon on twitter with feedback or

comments

or just say hey i appreciated this love

you all and i will see you next week
