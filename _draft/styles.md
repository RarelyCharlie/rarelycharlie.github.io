This is a scheme for describing different styles of listening. In this scheme there are two dimensions to listening: reflective focus, and point of view.

## Reflective focus
The reflective focus dimension has five styles.

**Emotional**

- Focus on feelings and emotions

**Mental**

- Focus on thoughts or mental processes when possible.

- Avoids specifically mentioning feelings or emotions.

**Behavioral**

- Focus on behaviors or actions when possible.

- Avoids specifically mentioning feelings or thoughts.

**Objective**

- Focus on objects, abstract ideas, generalizations, or other people, when possible.

- Avoids specifically mentioning anything personal to the member.

**Robotic**

- Ignores everything the member says.


### Examples
In these examples a member says:

<blockquote><em>Member:</em> Every time I go to the house I feel the fear again. Memories of what happened there flood back.</blockquote>

And here are five replies to illustrate the five listening styles:

<blockquote><em>Emotional:</em> The fear you always feel is the result of events in your past.</blockquote>

(Focus on the emotion.)

<blockquote><em>Mental:</em> Your memories of past events flood back when you go there.</blockquote>

(Focus on memories, a mental process. Avoids mentioning fear.)

<blockquote><em>Behavioral:</em> Going there always makes you feel the same way.</blockquote>

(Focus on going there, a behavior or action. Avoids mentioning fear or memories.)

<blockquote><em>Objective:</em> That house is a big problem for you.</blockquote>

(Focus on the house, an object. Avoids specifically mentioning anything personal.)

<blockquote><em>Robotic:</em> I'm sorry you feel that way. I fully understand what you are describing. Stuff like this is always so difficult! I'm so proud of you for reaching out the way you have. I really hope things will be better for you soon.</blockquote>

(Avoids mentioning anything the member said.)


## Point of view
The point of view dimension has four styles:

**Reflective**

- Describes the member's situation.
- Seeks understanding.
- Clarifies.
- Avoids owning the member's situation.

**Shared**

- Shares the member's situation
- Identifies problems.
- Suggests solutions.

**Advisory**

- Owns the member's situation.
- Gives advice
- Voices opinions.
- Makes judgments.
- Recommends resources.

**Self**

- Ignores the member's situation, or reflects it inaccurately.
- Describes the listener's own situation.
- Expresses the listener's own feelings and preferences.


### Examples
Again, in these examples a member says:

<blockquote><em>Member:</em> Every time I go to the house I feel the fear again. Memories of what happened there flood back.</blockquote>

And here are four replies to illustrate the listening styles:

<blockquote><em>Reflective:</em> The fear you always feel is the result of events in your past.</blockquote>

(Describes and clarifies the member's situation.)

<blockquote><em>Shared:</em> Perhaps you could try humming a favorite tune to block those memories.</blockquote>

(Identifies the memories as a problem and suggests a solution.)

<blockquote><em>Advisory:</em> Fear can always be overcome by practicing mindfulness.</blockquote>

(Expresses the listener's opinion.)

<blockquote><em>Self:</em> I completely understand how worried you must get when you visit that neighborhood and start to imagine those things.</blockquote>

(Expresses the listener's own feeling of complete understanding, inaccurately downgrades the member's fear to worry, upgrades the house to a whole neighborhood, and downgrades the memories to imagination.)
