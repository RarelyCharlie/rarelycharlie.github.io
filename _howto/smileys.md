You can type smileys (emoticons or emoji) in chats. There are two ways: automatic smileys and emoji characters.

### Automatic smileys
One way is to type a text smiley—punctuation that 7 Cups converts into an emoji character automatically.

For example, if you type `:)` you get 😊 when you send the message.

You can only get 14 emoji this way. They are:

|Confused   |`:\`  |😕|
|Crying     |`:'(` |😢|
|Devil      |`3:)` |😈|
|Gasp       |`:O`  |😮|
|Glasses    |`8)`  |🤓|
|Grin       |`:D`  |😀|
|Heart      |`<3`  |❤️|
|Kiss       |`:*`  |💋|
|Sad        |`:(`  |☹️|
|Smile      |`:)`  |😊|
|Grumpy     |`>:(` |😖|
|Sunglasses |`8|`  |😖|
|Tongue     |`:P`  |😛|
|Wink       |`;)`  |😉|

Some of these can be typed in alternative ways, but the alternatives are not shown here.

The emoji 7 Cups provides are not necessarily the standard emoji. For example, the standard Smiling Face emoji is ☺, but 7 Cups gives you Smiling Face with Smiling Eyes instead: 😊

### Emoji characters
The other way is to type an emoji character directly. This can be more difficult, but it gives you a much wider range of emoji to choose from.

There are various ways to type emoji characters:

- Your mobile device might provide an emoji keyboard or popup.
- You can copy and paste emoji characters from some websites, for example: [Emojipedia](https://emojipedia.org/)
- On a computer you might be able to copy and paste emoji characters from the character map.
- In some web browsers you can install an extension to insert emoji.

### Issues
Using emoji can cause problems, because the person you are chatting to might see a different emoji from the one you see, or they might just see a square, or nothing at all. It depends on the device, the software, and the installed fonts.

Even when emoji work, they don't always look good on everyone's screens, and they can be difficult to interpret.

This means that using emoji to convey important meaning is usually a bad idea, unless you're certain that anyone reading your message can see and understand the emoji. It's often better to make your meaning clear in words, and add emoji only for decoration and emphasis.
