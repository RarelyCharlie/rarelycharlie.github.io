This article describes provides a secure and easy way to create auto-updating taglists for 7 Cups.

You don't need a Google account or any special privilege at 7 Cups. There is no possibility of offsite contact.

### How it works

Each taglist is controlled by a public thread in a 7 Cups forum. This thread is the taglist's control thread. The person who creates the control thread (the original poster) owns the taglist.

To add yourself to any taglist, go to its control thread in the forums, press the Reply button at the top and write *the exact words* "Please add me."

To remove yourself from any taglist, go to its control thread in the forums, press the Reply button at the top and write *the exact words* "Please remove me."

The taglist uses these phrases to auto-update.

### Creating a new taglist

To create a new taglist, create a forum thread in the usual way. This will be the control thread.

The control thread can be anywhere in the forum. If you post it in a private area of the forum, then the taglist will be private—for example, listener-only or teen-only.

The title of the control thread must contain the word "taglist" or the phrase "tag list".

The top post should explain how the taglist works. For example, you could write:

<blockquote>
<p>This thread controls an auto-updating taglist.</p>
<p>To add yourself to this taglist, press the Reply button below and write the exact words: <b>Please add me</b></p>

<p>To remove yourself from this taglist, press the Reply button below and write the exact words: <b>Please remove me</b></p>

<p>To compile and use the list, see: <a href="https://www.7cups.com/forum/SiteUpdatesInformationFortheCommunity_100/SuggestionsandProblemSolving_383/TeaCakeCompilingautomatedtaglists_291762/">Tea & Cake — Compiling taglists</a></p>
</blockquote>

Whoever creates the control thread will be the taglist's owner.

### For owners of taglists
	
If you are the owner of a taglist or a 7 Cups admin you can give some other commands in the taglist's control thread in the forums. Press the Reply button at the top to give a command. Tags must start with @, and if you include more than one tag they must be separated by spaces, in the usual way.

 - "Please add: " followed by one or more tags `*`
 - "Please remove: " followed by one or more tags
 - "Please remove everyone."
 - "New owner " followed by one tag. This changes the taglist's owner.
 
`*` When adding a lot of tags, take care to ensure that they are all correct. The service does not validate them. Extra spaces, other unexpected characters, or missing @-signs can prevent the update from being processed in the way you expect. Using the separate [Clean up a taglist](https://rarelycharlie.github.io/howto/taglist-cleanup) service before adding a lot of tags is *very strongly recommended*.

For any other maintenance requirements, to suggest a new feature, or to report a problem, please send a message (PM) to [@RarelyCharlie](https://www.7cups.com/@RarelyCharlie).
