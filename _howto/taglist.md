The Taglist Service here provides a secure and easy way to create auto-updating taglists for 7 Cups.

You don't need a Google account or any special privilege at 7 Cups. There is no possibility of offsite contact.

To create a new taglist using this service, click here: [Create Taglist](/taglist). Follow the instructions.

### How it works

Each taglist is controlled by a public thread in a 7 Cups forum. This thread is the taglist's control thread. The person who creates the control thread (the original poster) owns the taglist.

To add yourself to any taglist, go to its control thread in the forums, press the Post to Thread button at the top and write *the exact words* "Please add me."

To remove yourself from any taglist, go to its control thread in the forums, press the Post to Thread button at the top and write *the exact words* "Please remove me."

The taglist uses these phrases to auto-update.

### Security

A taglist that uses this service is secure because it can only be updated from its registered forum thread. People can only add or remove themselves, not anyone else. Any attempt to add or remove someone else is simply ignored.

The ability to add or remove other people is restricted to the taglist's owner (normally the original poster of the forum thread), to 7 Cups admins, and to the owner of the service.

A taglist can be viewed on its own web page, but it cannot be changed there. The service stores taglists on a completely separate secure database server.

### For owners of taglists
	
If you are the owner of a taglist or a 7 Cups admin you can give some other commands in the taglist's control thread in the forums. Press the Post to Thread button to give a command. Tags must start with @, and if you include more than one tag they must be separated by spaces, in the usual way.

 - "Please add: " followed by one or more tags `*`
 - "Please remove: " followed by one or more tags
 - "Please remove everyone."
 
`*` When adding a lot of tags, take care to ensure that they are all correct. The service does not validate them. Extra spaces, other unexpected characters, or missing @-signs can prevent the update from being processed in the way you expect. Using the separate [Clean up a taglist](https://rarelycharlie.github.io/howto/taglist-cleanup) service before adding a lot of tags is *very strongly recommended*.

For any other maintenance requirements, to suggest a new feature, or to report a problem, please send a message (PM) to the service owner, [@RarelyCharlie](https://www.7cups.com/@RarelyCharlie).

**Notes:**
 - Only public control threads are supported. Control threads in private areas of the forums do not work. (For example, control threads in the listener and therapist areas do not work.)
 
 - When a taglist owner adds tags, there is no check that the tags are valid. (But when someone adds themselves, the tag is guaranteed to be valid at that time.)
 
 - In the event that this service runs into unforseen problems for any reason, taglist owners will be informed.
