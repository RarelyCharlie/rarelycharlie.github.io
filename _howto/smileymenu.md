This page describes how you might be able to enhance chats with a popup menu for inserting smileys in your messages.

<div style="border: 1px solid #a00; padding: 1ex; margin: 0 0 0 -1ex; color: #a00;"><b>Update pending</b><br>Some of the information on this page is out of date. It is due to be updated by Monday, February 8th, 2021.</div>

The 15 smileys in the menu are supported by 7 Cups. When you use them, everyone sees the same smileys.

If you insert other smileys in your messages, some people might not see them in the same way you do, and some 
people might not be able to see them at all. This depends on what kind of device they are using and how it is configured.

### Who can use the smiley menu?

You can probably use the smiley menu if you use 7 Cups in a web browser on a computer.

You might be able to use the smiley menu if you use 7 Cups in a web browser on an Android device.

You cannot use the smiley menu on an Apple iOS device.

You cannot use the smiley menu if you use the 7 Cups App on any kind of device.

### What you need
To use the smiley menu, you need to install two things in this order: 

1. First install [Tampermonkey](http://tampermonkey.net/) in your web browser.

   If your web browser is not compatible with Tampermonkey, then you cannot proceed with the next step
   (but you might be able to use the method for Apple iOS instead).

2. Next, install the [7 Cups - Chat smiley menu](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/396512-7-cups-chat-smiley-menu) script.

To install each of these in turn, click the relevant link and follow the instructions.
