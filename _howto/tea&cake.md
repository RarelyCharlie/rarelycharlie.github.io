Tea & Cake is a collection of enhancements and bug fixes for 7 Cups' website. (In the current version of Tea & Cake, there is only one enhancement. Others are planned.)

### Installation{: style="clear: both;"}
To install Tea & Cake, first install [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/). Most desktop and laptop browsers can install Tampermonkey, and some Android browsers also can (for example, [Kiwi](https://kiwibrowser.com/)). Apps and Apple iOS devices do not support it.

Next, install the [7 Cups - Tea & Cake](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/454925-7-cups-tea-cake) script. (If Tampermonkey is working, you should see a green Install button there.)

Finally, go to your [Listener Settings](https://www.7cups.com/listener/editAccount.php) or [Member Settings](https://www.7cups.com/member/editAccount.php) page. In the Tea & Cake section, check the boxes for the features you want to enable. These settings autosave, so there is no need to save the entire page after making changes.

Changes take effect when you reload any open 7 Cups pages.

Tea & Cake normally updates automatically when new versions become available.

### Watch group chats
This feature can watch group chats for trigger words that you specify.

In your Settings page, check the box "Watch group chats for these trigger words" and specify the trigger words you want to watch for, separated by spaces and without punctuation.

In each group chat that you want to monitor, press the "Watch this conversation" button in the toolbar at the top right.

To provide feedback on this feature, please reply in its [forum thread]() or message me.
